            <p>Hello, my name is Antony Laroche.  I was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
            I have a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Florida and a Master's in Engineering management.
            I have spent the last 18 years working in the refining industry in a wide variaty of roles ranging from process engineeing to project development
            and refinery economics. In addition to my work as an engineer, I have a passion for finance and economics.  As a result, I spend
            a lot of my spare time reading and analyzing the financial news of the day. I take pleasure in deciphering insights from
            the wealth of data available to us from news outlets and government agencies and converting those insight to personal investment
            strategies and general worldly advice.</p>
